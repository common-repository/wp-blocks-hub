WP Blocks Hub is a library of website elements (blocks, shortcodes, widgets) in the cloud. Unlike others plugins, you don't need to install 100500 blocks with "unlimited" unused options at once, thereby slowing down your website.

Search, download and install only blocks that are really needed and matched your concept and styling (like you do that with Plugins directly in your WP admin).

All of our blocks have quality premium design, easy to customize and available for most popular page builders (Gutenberg, Elementor, WPBakery Page Builder, Beaver Builder).

== Description ==

= WP Blocks Hub = 

Currently, plugin provides 59 Blocks for popular page builders (Gutenberg, Elementor, WPBakery Page Builder, Beaver Builder), shortcodes, widgets and custom post types to help you build amazing website on a WordPress platform. 

We have chosen the path of various concepts and designs instead of building blocks that complex to understand with "unlimited", mostly unused options. All of blocks use global styles, come with white and dark skins and works with any theme!

Control your style, fonts and colors: powerful global customization panel compiles and caches your changes on the fly without a headache. Once you setup your prefences, all blocks from the hub will follow these styles.

If you need any help, please don’t hesitate to contact us directly for any information, or be a part of a huge community using support forums, we are always happy to help!
